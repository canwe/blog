<p>The best way to reach me is through email. I do check my mails often in a day and will mostly respond soon.</p>
<p><strong>Email</strong> : veera.k.sundar@gmail.com</p>

<p>If you are into twitter, you can @mention me. But, honestly, I have never gotten a single @mention resulted from my blog. So, there's that. </p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong> : <a href="http://twitter.com/vraa">@vraa</a></p>

<p>If you are a recruiter, or a work friend, then the best medium of contact is through LinkedIn. I do my best to ignore my LinkedIn news feed (its just spam, you know), but give 100% attention to the direct messages I get.</p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerasundar">profile</a> </p>

<p>I live in east bay area. If you are nearby, you can track my address and stop by my door to surprise me. But, seriously, don't do it, that's creepy.</p>
