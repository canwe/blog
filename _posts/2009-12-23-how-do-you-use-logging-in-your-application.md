# How do you use logging in your application?

![How do you use logging in your application?][1]This time, I feel like conducting a poll and hear from you, instead of writing lengthy content. Similar to my other post, [What does it take to make a 'Ëœgood' developer resume?][2], this is also going to be a discussion post. Feel free to cast your vote and leave your comment at the end of this post.

I don't think there is a need to emphasize on the importance of logging in software. Logging helps to maintain a track record of what happened in the application. A good logging framework helps the developer to use logging effectively without affecting the application's performance. For Java applications, [Log4j][3] is always considered as one of the popular logging framework.

That said about logging, here is the poll for you to vote.

## Logging Framework or No Logging at all?
