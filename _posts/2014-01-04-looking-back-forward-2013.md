One more year has passed and we made it so far after the deadly 2012 end-of-the-world incident. Kudos to us.

As I usually do at the end of each year ([2008](http://veerasundar.com/blog/2008/12/a-very-happy-new-year-to-all-the-readers-of-dreamz/), [2009](http://veerasundar.com/blog/2009/12/so-long-2009-welcome-2010/), [2010](http://veerasundar.com/blog/2010/12/so-long-2010-welcome-2011/), [2011](http://veerasundar.com/blog/2011/12/looking-back-and-forward/), [2012](http://veerasundar.com/blog/2012/12/looking-back-and-forward-2012/)), here's the retro post about how things went in 2013 for myself/this blog.

## Last year resolutions

Last time, I decided on three things to do in 2013.

1. **Release treesk.com** - Nope. Didn't do it. Damn, its hard to focus and launch something. But as a consolation, released [countrack.me](http://countrack.me), so *yay!* for that. :)
2. **Write more** - Kinda worked on it. Started writing few technical articles again in this blog. But not much as I would have liked. Should do better.
3. **Open source timethetask.com** - [Nailed it](https://github.com/vraa/timethetask)! :)

## 2014 Resolutions

1. Stop writing 2013 at first and then correcting it to 2014.

Neh, just kidding. This year, there are no specific resolutions. Instead, there's going to be one objective that I'm gonna apply at all things that I do - be it personal life, career, dreams. That'll be:

>**Go to next level**.

You know, once you get confortable with something, it is hard to get out of that comfort zone. But it is very, very important to move on, try new things, fail and learn. So, 2014 is going to be one such year, where I am gonna try new things and see how they work. 

That'll be it. Though it's little late, I take this moment to wish each and every one of you a happy and successfull new year!
