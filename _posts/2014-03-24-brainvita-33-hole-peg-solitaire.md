I had some free time this week. So set out to build a simple board game in JavaScript to refresh my skills. For this, I chose one of my favorite board game which I used to play all the time when I was a kid. The game is called as **Brainvita (a.k.a 33 Hole Peg Solitaire)** and is a board puzzle.

The objective of the game is to remove the marbles that are there in the board according to the rules of the game. The more marbles your remove, the better.

Here's the screenshot of the game:

You can [play Brainvita here](http://veerasundar.com/33holepegsolitaire/). The code is [open source](https://github.com/vraa/33holepeg).

Please give it a try and feel free to share your feedback.
