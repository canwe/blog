# So long 2009, Welcome 2010!

2009 is one of those unforgettable years in my life, both at personal and professional levels. Some success, some failures, some struggles and some achievements - overall, 2009 had been a well balanced in terms of events. Well, I'm not going to discuss all of those here because if I do, you might click on the '˜X' on the top-right of your screen. Instead, I'll just record some of my thoughts that are related to this blog alone. Let's start:

## I was more active in blog than the previous year:

Yes, I was. You can see that yourself by looking at the **post count** in the Sidebar *Archives* section. Out of the **175 posts** that I published till now, **121 posts** were published this year. [July 2009][1] tops the ranking with 18 posts!

## My Blog performed very well in 2009:

My active blogging was reflected by the good amount of traffic that my blog recieved. Here's a snapshot of my blog's traffic stats from WordPress.

And my post '[Closing the last tab in Firefox 3.5][3]' was one of the popular post with more than 8000 views this year, while my other article '[15 creative Java applications based on Netbeans platform][4]' was [featured][5] in Netbeans.org home page.

Well, I meant the '˜combined' stats, not USA! anyway, here's the comparision between my [last year's stats][6] and the current year's.

## On the Dev side, I released 3 apps:

While I was working/blogging hard, I was also spending some time to realize my ideas. I released three applications, well each of them were developed using different technology. Here are they for you:

**[CSS Sorter][9]** is a Java application that sorts the CSS rules alphabetically. 
[![][11]][11] **[Timelinr][11]** is a PHP based web application to create timelines online. 
[![][13]][13] **[Stockr][13]** is a Firefox extension for tracking share prices online.

## Thank you, my Readers! YOU made this possible:
