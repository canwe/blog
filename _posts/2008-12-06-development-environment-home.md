Recently I was reading a blog post [Personal development environment][1], in which the author was asking the readers to share what are the software they use for their personal projects. We all use advanced,enterprise development applications at office, because the company pays for it. But when it comes to home/personal projects, we can not afford for a commercial IDE just to develop Hello World application. So, most of us would go for a open source / free development applications. I am too not an exception for this rule. So, here goes my list of applications that I use for my personal projects.

*   **[Eclipse IDE][2]** - The free integrated development environment that suits perfectly for my programming needs.
*   **[Notepad ][3]** - feature rich, light weight alternative for Notepad. I like Notepad 's ability to color code more than 30 languages. I use it as my default SQL editor. (If you worked in AS400 STRSQL editor, then you will know how much I like Notepad as my SQL editor)
*   **[Visual SVN][4]** - as my windows Subversion server. Easy to install and a good GUI for the Subversion.
*   **[Tortoise SVN][5]** - as my windows Subversion client. I am using [Subclipse][6] also as a subversion plug-in in eclipse.
*   **[XAMPP][7]** - using it to design and test my wordpress blogs.
*   **[WinSCP][8]** is an open source SFTP client and FTP client for Windows. Its main function is the secure file transfer between a local and a remote computer. Beyond this, WinSCP offers basic file manager functionality. It uses Secure Shell (SSH) and supports, in addition to Secure FTP, also legacy SCP protocol.
