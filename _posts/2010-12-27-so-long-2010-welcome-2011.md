# So long 2010, Welcome 2011

![firefoworks][1]First of all, let me wish you a **happy holidays** and advanced wishes for the **wonderful new year**!

While we are so busy with our work and other stuff, the clock never stopped ticking and yet another year has passed away in-front of our eyes. To compensate this, the Time (not that *[Time][2]*!) has gifted us a brand new year - **2011**. So, lets start live in the present than worry about the past.

Enough ofÂ philosophiesÂ andÂ preaching. Lets come to the point of this post. That is, sharing my stats, as I did on [last year][3].

## Last year resolutions:

Last year I had [three resolutions][4].

 [4]: http://veerasundar.com/blog/2010/01/happy-birthday-2010/ "Happy Birthday, 2010!"

*   Build a better blog - Which, I think, is accomplished by looking at the [stats below][5]. But, the mission does not end here. ![:)][6] 
*   Learn a new language (Scala, Python) - unfortunately, this one is still open. But, I did learn new (markup) languages after joining PayPal. But still, Scala is in my mind always.
*   Learn photography and buy a DSLR - Done. Bought one DSLR and learnt some basics of photography. But a long way to go. Here are some clicks for you: [Photos 1][7] , [Photos 2][8] and [Flickr][9].

## New year resolutions for 2011:

Time to set some new goals.

*   To release the new website that I'm currently working on.
*   To learn a new language (Rails and Scala are in, as of now).
*   To network with more and more people in my field.

I think three is enough. So, what are your resolutions? Do share it in comments and leave a link to your blog post.

## Important events for veerasundar.com/blog:

*   Last year, this blog fetched some good advertisement offers. I spent that money again for improving this blog itself: [Bought the Thesis theme][10] and setup an [additional monitor][11] (and btw,Â Â If you like to advertise here, do [contact me][12] ![:)][6] )
*   The total number of page views crossed **4,00,000** and as of today it is 4,24,140. That's some number! (source: wordpress.com stats)
