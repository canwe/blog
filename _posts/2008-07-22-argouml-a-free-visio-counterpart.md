Recently, I have been asked to evaluate a UML modeling tool, [ArgoUML ][1]and below are my initial impressions on this tool:

 [1]: http://argouml.tigris.org/ "ArgoUML"

*   More standards compliant (have to be familiar with all UML terms, in order to efficiently use this application!)
*   Generation of source code from the model (which is not supported in Visio)
*   Supports Java, C#, C and PHP too.
*   Pretty fast in execution, even though the UI is based on Java.. (may be I tried only small example!)
*   Usability is okay - easy to understand the UI.
*   And its FREE!

I have always dreamed of designing a complete Java application using any modeling tools and I think AgroUML will help me in realizing my dream!
