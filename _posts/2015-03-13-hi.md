Well, well, well... look who's back! Yeah, its me! :)

Just kidding. It's been almost 6 months since I wrote anything in this blog. It was crazy time at my current workplace, where we were trying very hard to bring the product to release. It was a challenging task but as a side effect, did not get any time to focus on my writing or a side project. 

Given the product has reached a stable state, now I am getting some air to breathe. So, that's the reason of this post - to say Hi to my (nearly non-existent) readers. :P

Looking forward to get back on blogging.
