# Fix for viewing Tamil font in Chrome &#8211; Ubuntu

It seems like the Chrome browser in Ubuntu has some issues in displaying Tamil fonts. I guess, other Indian languages also might be having the same issue. The weirdest thing is Firefox was displaying the Tamil content properly.

So, after searching through the Chromium group for a while, found the fix for this issue.

## To fix Tamil font in Ubuntu Chrome

1.  Open Terminal
2.  Go to the folder: **cdÂ /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont**
3.  Delete *FreeSerif.ttf: ***sudo rm FreeSerif.ttf**
4.  Delete *FreeSans.ttf: ***sudo rm FreeSans.ttf**
5.  Close and re-open the browser.

The Tamil font should be displayed properly now.
