# starUML and argoUML &#8211; compared

** 
I have been using few UML modeling tools like argoUML and starUML for quite some time. I have [already blogged][1] about my first impressions on argoUML.In that blog post, one user replied that I should have a look at starUML which is also free/open source and is lot better than the argoUML modeling tool. So, I tried starUML also. After using both UML modeling tools, here are my observations on them.



## starUML

[**starUML**][2] is an open source UML modeling application licensed under a modified version of GNU GPL. Since the goal of starUML is to compete with the commercial UML modeling applications like Microsoft's Visio and IBM's Rational Rose, starUML boasts a complete set of UML modeling features.

#### Pros / Features of starUML

*   Supports most of the diagrams specified in UML 2.0.
*   Very rich feature set and formatting options.
*   Ability to generate source code from the UML diagram.
*   Reverse engineer the existing code into UML diagrams.
*   Supported languages : C , C# and Java.
*   Fast load time/execution time compared with other UML tools.
*   Familiar *Visual Studio* like user interface.
*   Supports exporting diagrams into JPG / XMI formats.

#### Cons of starUML

*   Does not supports exporting diagrams into SVG format.

## argoUML

[**argoUML**][3] is written in Java and released under open source BSD License. argoUML is not yet developed completely, still is in **O.xx** versions. As it is already available in market and used by many developers around the world, I am putting my reviews on this UML tool. 

#### Pros / Features of argoUML

**

*   Written in Java, so runs in all the platforms where Java runs.
*   Supports Code generation from the UML diagram / UML Diagram generation from the code.
*   Currently supported languages are C , C#, Java and PHP.
*   Ability to manage ToDo list.
*   Export UML diagram into XMI / JPG / SVG / PS formats.

#### Cons of argoUML

*   Not fully supports UML 2.0.
*   Can't Undo! Developers of argoUML must be so optimistic that people (especially Software Developers) never do mistakes. ![:)][4] 
*   Written in Java, so run comparatively slower than starUML.
*   Lack of formatting options.

After using these two UML modeling tools, **I recommend starUML** for any developer.

What is your opinion on these two UML tools? Are they capable of replacing Visio and Rational Rose? Are there any other Free / Open Source UML modeling tools that I am missing here? Please leave your thoughts in the [comments section][5].
