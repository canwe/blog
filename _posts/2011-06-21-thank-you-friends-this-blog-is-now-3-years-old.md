# Thank you friends! This blog is now 3 years old.

Well, well, well, I completely forgot that I started this blog on this same month, three years ago. Yes! Now this blog completes **3 years **and steps into the fourth year.

Of course, without your support and feedback, this wouldn't have happened. So, **thank you one and all **for reading my blog and encouraging me through comments.

Its time for some retrospection. Let's seeÂ  how this blog performed till now (thanks to WordPress Stats and Google Analytics for tracking the data)
