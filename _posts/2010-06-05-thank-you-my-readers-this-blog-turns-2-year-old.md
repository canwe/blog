# Thank you my readers! This blog turns 2 year old!!

First of all, let me say a BIG THANKS to all my readers who visited, read my posts, commented,  sent me emails, joined my network, subscribed to my posts  (and *some times* clicked on the ads ![:)][1] ). Because of all your positive feedback, this blog turns **2 year old** in this month (June 3rd to be exact) . Thank you again, my readers.

It was a wonderful experience to be blogging for the past 2 years. It earned me several good friends and it gave an unique identity for myself in the cyberspace. I used to be so happy when people read my tutorials and email me to clarify their doubts. I hope I responded to all of them usefully. At that time I used to feel like I built something that is \*little\* useful to other folks. I pledge that I'll continue to do the same.

## Time for some numbers:
