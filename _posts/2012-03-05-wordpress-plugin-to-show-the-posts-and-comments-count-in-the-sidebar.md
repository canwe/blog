As part of this blog's re-design, I wanted to show the number of posts and comments as a widget in the sidebar. But I couldn't find a plugin that does exactly what I wanted. So, I wrote one on my own.

Below is the source code for this wordpress plug-in which you can drop it in your *plugins *folder and then activate it as usual. Then, in your *Widgets*Â section, you'll see a new widget that you can use it in your sidebar.

## Source for WordPress StatsBoard plugin to display the posts and comments count:

[gist id='1976268']

You can use the plugin however the way you want, of course, at your own risk! ![:)][1]
