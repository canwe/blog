So, tell me, how many times have you annoyed with very long pages (such as this blog) and wished for a single click way to jump to top of the page!? If your answer is *many, *then this tip might give you some relief - **add a bookmarklet to your bookmarks toolbar that jumps to the top of the page for you.**

Here's the dead simple way to do it. Just drag this link to your bookmarks toolbar: [^][1]

 [1]: javascript:window.scrollTo(0,0);

Here are the manual steps:

1.  Add a new bookmark.
2.  In the *name *field, enter either ^ or UP or \*whatever\*!
3.  In the location/URL field, enter: *javascript:window.scrollTo(0,0);*
4.  Save it.

Happy jumping around!
