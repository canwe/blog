How long can a writers block last? My personal record seems to be 6 months.

{% include post-ad.html %}

The last time I wrote something in this blog is on [October, 2015](http://veerasundar.com/blog/2015/10/rewrite-iterator-generator-example-in-es6/). Between then and now, a lot of things have happened.

* I moved to US for work.
* I got a new job at Visa.
* My office work took most of my free time and the energy.
* The unlimited internet of America spoiled me. :)

I guess those reasons were enough (especially the last one) to justify the inactivity of this blog. But, past is past, I have decided to refocus my efforts of writing frequently in here. I just need to find the content and time to write, like the one I am doing right now, writing about the plan to write.

And, btw, if you haven't noticed yet, I redesigned this blog (if you have noticed, **thanks**). Do let me how does it look. I have also heavily modified the Jekyll blog structure. If you are interested, you can take a look at [the source code](https://github.com/vraa/blog). I'll be writing about the redesign process soon.
