Ever since I started blogging, during end of the year I used to write a [retrospection of things][1] I did in that year. It has kinda become a traditionÂ to meÂ and an excuse for a new post. As the yearÂ **2012Â **has only a day of fuel left in it, let me stop and look back.

## Last year resolutions:

You follow them or not, but you must make a list of new years resolutions. So, did I. For 2012, I had [three things][2] in my mind.

1.  ReleaseÂ **treesk.comÂ **- it's my web app that I've started working on during the first quarter of 2012. Initially I planned to release it before 2012, but due to some personnel setbacks (definitely not because of *Mayans's*), I couldn't. But I'm quite happy with its current progress. The 0.9 version of it 'Ëœ*almost*'Ëœ ready and I'm hoping that the 1.0 version will see the light before first quarter of 2013.
2.  Get a new job - I did kinda get a *newÂ *job. I mean, I joinedÂ *PayPalÂ *again. Even though I worked at PayPal for last 2 years, I was a CSC employee then. Last year, I directly joined PayPal. Not sure what 2013 has in its store for my career! ![:)][3] 
3.  Improve skills in photography - totally nuked this. I hardly took out my Camera last year (apart from the time when I was in [San Jose/San Francisco][4]). Next year, SHOULD.GO.FOR.PHOTO.WALKS.

## New year resolutions:

1.  ReleaseÂ **treesk**. Make it reach people.Â 
2.  Write. A lot. Get back to blogging. And, possibly an eBook.
3.  Open source [**timethetask**][5].
