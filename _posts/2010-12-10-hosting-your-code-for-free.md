Sometime back, I wrote about [Java web application hosting][1], in which I listed out the different options available to you to [host your Java web applications][2]. Now, let's look at the different solutions to **host your code**.

Before you dive in, please note that:

1.  Most (if not all) of the services provide the free plan only with basic features. Want more, pay them! ![:)][3] 
2.  The focus is on Subversion hosting only (because at the end you might wonder why Github wasn't be seen in the list!).
